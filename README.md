# Hello

*WELCOME TO MY PORTFOLIO*


My name is Tahini and I’m an Indian graphic designer and creative thinker based in Ottawa,ON . My inspiration comes from exploring and creating new adventures! I enjoy all types of design but I’m particularly passionate about branding, packaging and print. Drop me a line to say hello!

I'm really excited for this website because I want to showcase my passion for graphic design and creative thinking.

## Knowledgable In
1. Print
2. Motion
3. Web Development
4. Interactive Design
5. Branding

###My Motivation
I intend on working for a graphic design studio that specializes in printmaking, advertising and branding. I think most companies look at students and see the way they think and how creative they are. That is the motivation behind my work; to be different and to be creative and make work that studio directors will notice.
